  "description": "Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) Streaming is the de-facto standard for delivering video and audio content over the Internet. Dynamically adapting to the varying throughput on the client side is a key feature for media players. A testbed that simulates different network conditions based on pre-defined trajectories is a valuable tool to improve existing ABR algorithms in the media players. As part of this project you will implement a web-based editor to define different bandwidth trajectories. The editor is supposed to be an easy to use tool that outputs the graphically defined trajectory in JSON format, e.g [{duration:5000, speed:300},{duration:5000, speed:500}].",
